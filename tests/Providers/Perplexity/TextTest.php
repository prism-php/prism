It is springtime there, with pleasant conditions suitable for outdoor activities and light clothing[1][3].\n\nHowever, November also marks a period with relatively frequent rain, averaging about **15 rainy days** and **119 mm (4.7 inches) of precipitation** in the month, meaning around 50% of the days may have some rainfall. Rain tends to occur intermittently rather than continuous heavy storms[1][3].\n\nDaylight is about **13 hours** long, and the sea temperature in coastal areas is around **22°C (71 °F)**, cool but comfortable for swimming[1].\n\nWind conditions are moderate, with an average wind scale of 4 (on a general scale), and UV index can be high during sunny periods[1][4].\n\nIn summary:\n\n| Aspect           | Details                         |\n|------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Temperature      | ~24°C (75°F) day, ~18°C (64°F) night |\n| Rainfall         | About 15 rainy days; 119 mm (~4.7 in) monthly |\n| Daylight         | ~13 hours                      |\n| Sea temperature  | ~22°C (71°F)                   |\n| Wind             | Moderate (scale 4)             |\n| Weather type     | Warm, partly cloudy, intermittent rain, comfortable for outdoor activities |\n\nThus, southern Brazil in November is warm and partly rainy, with pleasant temperatures and a mix of sun and showers typical for the spring season[1][3][4]."
