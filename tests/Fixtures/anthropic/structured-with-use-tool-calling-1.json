In the story, a supercomputer named Deep Thought is built to calculate the answer to this ultimate question. After 7.5 million years of computation, it provides the famous answer: 42. However, the computer explains that the answer seems meaningless because the beings who asked didn't actually understand the question itself. This has become one of the most recognized references in science fiction and popular culture. Beyond Adams' work, the meaning of life has been explored in many other fictional works, often with humorous, philosophical, or existential perspectives.","answer":"In popular fiction, the most famous answer to \"the meaning of life, the universe and everything\" is \"42,\" as established in Douglas Adams' \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\" In this comedic science fiction series, a supercomputer called Deep Thought calculates this seemingly nonsensical answer after 7.5 million years, only to explain that the beings who asked didn't properly understand their own question. This answer has become a cultural touchstone, representing both the absurdity of seeking simple answers to profound questions and the often humorous futility of such cosmic inquiries. Beyond Adams' work, fiction has explored this question in countless waysâ€”from Kurt Vonnegut's fatalistic \"so it goes\" in Slaughterhouse-Five to more optimistic perspectives in works like \"The Good Place\" that suggest meaning comes from human connections and moral growth."}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":603,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":524,"service_tier":"standard"}}
