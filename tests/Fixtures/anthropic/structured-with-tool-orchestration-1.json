Key areas include alignment research (ensuring AI systems pursue intended goals), robustness testing (making AI systems reliable under various conditions), interpretability research (understanding how AI systems make decisions), and governance frameworks (establishing policies for responsible AI development). Current challenges involve the alignment problem where advanced AI might optimize for unintended objectives, potential risks from rapid capability advancement outpacing safety measures, and the need for international coordination on AI safety standards. Research organizations like Anthropic, OpenAI, and the Center for AI Safety are actively working on technical safety solutions including constitutional AI, reward modeling, and AI oversight techniques.","sources":"Internal database search results on AI safety topics; External API data from ai-safety-research endpoint"}}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":749,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":323,"service_tier":"standard"}}
