This is perfect baseball weather - warm enough to be comfortable but not too hot. You might want to bring sunglasses and sunscreen instead, and perhaps a light shirt or jersey to show your Tigers support!\n\nHave a great time at the game!"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":676,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":127,"service_tier":"standard"}}
