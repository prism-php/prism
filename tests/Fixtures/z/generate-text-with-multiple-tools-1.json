Whether they should wear a coat (which relates to weather)\n\nI have two tools available:\n- get_weather: to check weather for a city\n- search_games: to search for current game times in a city\n\nFor the first question about the Tigers game time, I should use search_games with \"Detroit\" as the city.\n\nFor the second question about wearing a coat, I should use get_weather with \"Detroit\" as the city to check the weather conditions.\n\nBoth tools require the \"city\" parameter, and the user has specified \"Detroit\" clearly, so I have all the required parameters.",
